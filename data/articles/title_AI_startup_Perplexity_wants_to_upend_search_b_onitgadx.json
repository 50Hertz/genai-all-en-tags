{"title": "AI startup Perplexity wants to upend search business. News outlet Forbes says it's ripping them off", "timestamp": "\"2024-06-14 05:59:34\"", "content": ["The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has raised tens of millions of dollars from the likes of Jeff Bezos and other prominent tech investors for its mission to rival Google in the business of searching for information.", "But its AI-driven search chatbot is already facing challenges as some news media companies object to its business practices. It is also competing against t ech giants Google, and now Apple, which are increasingly fusing similar AI features into their core products.", "Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has spent much of the past week defending the company after it published a summarized news story with information and similar wording to a Forbes investigative story but without citing the media outlet or asking for its permission. Forbes said it later found similar \u201cknock-off\u201d stories lifted from other publications.", "The Associated Press separately found another Perplexity product feature inventing fake quotes from real people, including a former elected town official from Martha\u2019s Vineyard falsely quoted to say he didn\u2019t want the Massachusetts island to become a destination for marijuana.", "\u201cI never said that,\u201d said Bill Rossi, a former member of the island town of Chilmark\u2019s select board.", "Srinivas told The Associated Press that his company is trying to build positive relationships with news publishers that ensure their news content \u201creaches more people.\u201d", "\u201cWe can definitely coexist and help each other,\u201d he said.", "Asked about Forbes, he said his product \u201cnever ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else\u2019s content,\u201d in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies\u2019 AI systems generate.", "\u201cWe are actually more of an aggregator of information and providing it to the people with the right attribution,\u201d Srinivas said. But, he added, \u201cIt was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source. We took that feedback immediately and updated changes that day itself. And now the sources are more prominently highlighted.\u201d", "Perplexity also revealed this week that it has been seeking revenue-sharing partnerships that would pay news publishers a portion of Perplexity\u2019s advertising revenue each time an outlet\u2019s news content is referenced as a source.", "Randall Lane, chief content officer of Forbes Media, called the dispute an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the conversation about AI.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a case study in where we\u2019re heading,\u201d Lane told the AP. \u201cIf the people who are leading the charge don\u2019t have a fundamental respect for the hard work of doing proprietary reporting, and keeping people informed with value-added content, we\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d", "A self-described \u201cAI bull\u201d who believes that the technology could help make many news organizations more efficient, Lane said the dispute between Perplexity and Forbes is important because it is a \u201cmetaphor for what can happen if the people controlling the AI don\u2019t respect the people doing the work.\u201d", "Perplexity bills itself as a search engine while \u201cacting like a media company and publishing a story\u201d that only Forbes had reported, Lane said.", "\u201cThe whole thing was very disingenuous. And what we didn\u2019t hear was, \u2018Oops, yeah we messed that one up and we need to do better,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it was just putting out more content, little tweaks to the model and treating journalism like it\u2019s just a commodity to be manufactured.\u201d", "Srinivas, a computer scientist and former AI researcher at OpenAI and Google, co-founded Perplexity in the summer of 2022, not long before the AI image-generator Stable Diffusion and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT began sparking the public's fascination with the possibilities of generative AI.", "Inspired, in part, by his childhood love of Wikipedia, he described Perplexity to the AP as \u201clike a marriage of Wikipedia and ChatGPT\u201d that can instantly answer a person\u2019s questions without the \u201chuge cluttered mess\u201d of Google\u2019s conventional search results.", "\u201cYou ask a question, you get an answer with clean sources, and there\u2019s like three or four suggested (follow-up) questions and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said of Perplexity. \u201cThat way people\u2019s minds can be free from distractions, and they can just focus on learning and digging deeper.\u201d", "The company sells a subscription for premium features and is planning to start an advertising-based service as it grows its user base.", "\u201cWe are not profitable as a company today, but we are also more sustainably run than foundation model companies because we do not train our own foundation models,\u201d which requires huge amounts of computing power, he said.", "Perplexity relies on existing AI large language models such as those built by OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook; and then \u201cpost-trains\u201d them.", "\u201cWe shape them to be really good summarizers,\u201d he said.", "It\u2019s not always clear where the summarized information is coming from. One Perplexity feature called Writing \u2014 which enables a user to \u201cgenerate text or chat without searching the web\u201d \u2014 produces lengthy and unsourced commentary, often in the style of a news article. Tests of the feature by an AP reporter asking it to write about the lack of marijuana on Martha\u2019s Vineyard led it to produce a 465-word document that resembled a news article and included fabricated quotations from the former town official and another real person.", "The AP is not repeating the false quotes in order to avoid perpetuating misinformation. Srinivas said that the Writing feature of Perplexity is a \u201cminor use case\u201d that was intended for helping to compose essays or correcting grammar when primary source information isn\u2019t needed. He said it's \u201cmore prone to hallucinations\u201d \u2014 a common problem with AI large language models \u2014 because it isn't tethered to the web search capabilities of Perplexity's core product.", "\u201cThere is no doubt that generative AI is upending journalism, content creation, and search,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.", "She pointed to Google\u2019s new, Perplexity-like approach that summarizes answers based on information pulled from crawling the web, as an example. That, too, led to false information and forced Google to make adjustments to the product after its public release.", "\u201cBut their whole model of advertising is based on sending people to websites,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhy will people go to websites if they can have the one-stop-shop of the answer in the AI output?\u201d", "Srinivas claimed to the AP that \u201ca lot of people get referrals from Perplexity, and I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re getting referrals from a new player in the internet.\"", "For now, much of that benefit may be aspirational. Perplexity\u2019s worldwide user base has grown rapidly this year to more than 85 million web visits in May, but that barely registers compared to the billions of users of ChatGPT and other popular platforms from Microsoft and Google, according to data from Similarweb.", "The debate demonstrates the \u201cuncertain and challenging times\u201d for online content creators in general and journalism in particular because aggregators only work if publications such as Forbes exist, said Stephen Lind, an associate professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business.", "Using AI as a synthesizing tool works for widespread dissemination of information until \u201cyou run out of originals,\u201d he said.", "\u201cThere are whole companies or whole applications that are also doing this, where they are rolling out new services without fully thinking through the implications or best practices or safeguards because they\u2019re rolling out applications for industries that maybe they\u2019re not native to,\u201d he said.", "Lind said it\u2019s good that companies like Perplexity are \u201ctaking at least some steps to course correct when an industry or a user pushes back.\u201d But some of the changes should have been baked in from the beginning, he added."]}
