But as NASA has said, there are only a handful of worlds that warrant a closer look.", "One of the biggest scientific questions scientists hope to answer is whether these exoplanets are (or were) habitable, which could significantly advance our understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth, and whether life outside of our solar system is possible.", "However, studying exoplanets is challenging because they do not emit detectable light like stars. This makes detailed study possible only for transiting exoplanets \u2014 those that pass between their host star and Earth, causing a detectable dip in the star\u2019s brightness, allowing scientists to deduce properties such as size and orbital distance.", "The recently discovered exoplanet, Gliese 12 b, located in the constellation Pisces, is one such transiting exoplanet. Its proximity, at about 40 light-years from Earth, makes it one of the closest known exoplanets, simplifying its study even further.", "Using the TESS Space Observatory, which first observed the planet in August 2021, along with numerous ground-based telescopes, the researchers concluded that Gliese 12 b is very similar to Earth and Venus in many respects.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, an assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo.", "Is Gliese 12 b reminiscent of Earth or Venus?", "Detailed observations reveal that Gliese 12 b orbits an M-dwarf star, which is significantly smaller and cooler than our own Sun. However, because its orbit is about 15 times closer to its star than Earth is it receives a similar amount of heat. The dimensions of Gliese 12 b are also very close to those of Earth, with their radii differing by only about 10 percent.", "These remarkable similarities raise crucial questions about the planet\u2019s atmosphere, which affects surface temperature and the potential for liquid water; both key factors for habitability.", "\u201cMuch of the scientific value of this planet is to understand what kind of atmosphere it could have,\u201d Dholakia explained. \u201cSince Gliese 12 b gets in between the amount of light as Earth and Venus get from the Sun, it will be valuable for bridging the gap between these two planets in our solar system.\u201d", "\u201cThe Earth is habitable, but Venus is not due to its complete loss of water,\u201d added Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London, who co-led the study with Dholakia. \u201cBecause Gliese 12 b is between Earth and Venus in temperature, its atmosphere could teach us a lot about the habitability pathways planets take as they develop.\u201d", "The James Webb Telescope will provide the necessary insights", "However, the instruments used in the current study were not sensitive enough to analyze the planet\u2019s atmosphere in detail. More advanced tools are needed to determine how similar Gliese 12 b\u2019s atmosphere is to Earth or Venus.", "One possibility is the James Webb Space Telescope, which has unprecedented resolution thanks to a combination of ultra-sensitive optics and its orbiting location. These factors both help reduce noise produced by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and solar radiation to almost zero.", "Future studies with James Webb or similar instruments will hopefully determine similarities and differences between Earth and Gliese 12 b, shedding light on potentially habitable worlds in the Universe \u2014 particularly around M-dwarf stars, which are abundant in our galaxy.", "References: Shishir Dholakia, et al., Gliese 12 b, a temperate Earth-sized planet at 12 parsecs discovered with TESS and CHEOPS, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2024).
