They have created an ultrasoft \u201cskin-like\u201d material \u2014 that\u2019s both breathable and stretchable \u2014 for use in the development of an on-skin, wearable bioelectronic device capable of simultaneously tracking multiple vital signs such as blood pressure, electrical heart activity and skin hydration.", "\u201cOur overall goal is to help improve the long-term biocompatibility and the long-lasting accuracy of wearable bioelectronics through the innovation of this fundamental porous material which has many novel properties,\u201d said Yan, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.", "Made from a liquid-metal elastomer composite, the material\u2019s key feature is its skin-like soft properties.", "\u201cIt is ultrasoft and ultra-stretchable, so when the device is worn on the human body, it will be mechanically imperceptible to the user,\u201d Yan said. \u201cYou cannot feel it, and you will likely forget about it. This is because people can feel about 20 kilopascals or more of pressure when something is stretched on their skin, and this material creates less pressure than that.\u201d", "Its integrated antibacterial and antiviral properties can also help prevent harmful pathogens from forming on the surface of the skin underneath the device during extended use.", "\u201cWe call it a mechanical and electrical decoupling, so when the material is stretched, there is only a small change in the electrical performance during human motion, and the device can still record high-quality biological signals from the human body,\u201d Yan said.", "While other researchers have worked on similar designs for liquid-metal elastomer composites, Yan said the MU team has a novel approach because the breathable \u201cporous\u201d material they developed can prevent the liquid metal from leaking out when the material is stretched as the human body moves.", "The work builds on the team\u2019s existing proof of concept, as demonstrated by their previous work including a heart monitor currently under development. In the future, Yan hopes the biological data gathered by the device could be wirelessly transmitted to smartphone or similar electronics for future sharing with medical professionals.", "\u201cPorous liquid metal\u2013elastomer composites with high leakage resistance and antimicrobial property for skin-interfaced bioelectronics\u201d was published in Science Advances, a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
