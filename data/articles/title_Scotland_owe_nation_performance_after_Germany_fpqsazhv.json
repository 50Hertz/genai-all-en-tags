It's about what's now going to happen.", "Glancing sombrely back on Scotland's heavy defeat by Germany on Friday night, it was always a possibility something like that could befall us.", "My thought before it was, if we were at our very best we might have got a draw - we weren\u2019t. The Germans were a lot more up for it, confident. Toni Kroos was superb, their two wide players were exceptional.", "They saw where our weaknesses were and they went at them. It\u2019s really good technical management.", "It\u2019s a tough night for the players. And also a tough night for the head coach, Steve Clarke.", "Steve will be sensible but serious about what happened on Friday night.", "He obviously knows these things better than I do, but I\u2019d like to have had wee Billy Gilmour in there. These tournaments, it\u2019s about keeping the ball, because if you give it away, you don\u2019t get it back for five minutes, you end up chasing shadows.", "When you play top technical teams, the one thing you must do is hold the ball. He\u2019s our best.", "Steve will go through every aspect of the game. Although I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go through every technical mistake and bad pass, that\u2019s not the problem.", "We had a game plan that really, really, really didn\u2019t work. So, when that\u2019s happening, you think \u2018right, let\u2019s look at this\u2019.", "We ended up playing a 5-4-1 and it didn\u2019t work for us. You can\u2019t allow that to happen against the Swiss- and I don\u2019t think Steve will. He\u2019ll be thinking \"how do I change it?\".", "I mean, you get one sent off, but it was done before that. It was already looking like four, five or six.", "Ryan Porteous will be disappointed because he let himself down.", "It was a horrifying tackle. Hopefully I\u2019m fair-minded enough that, when I saw the replay, I wanted him sent off. I don\u2019t want to see a tackle like that happen to anyone.", "The first thing he should do is apologise to Ilkay Gundogan. The red mist comes down and he does it out of desperation, but you can\u2019t do that. Your team-mates are knackered now after chasing shadows.", "It\u2019s a big error, but did it make a huge difference? Probably not."]}
