{"title": "Erik ten Hag to stay as Manchester United manager", "timestamp": "\"2024-06-10 13:21:00\"", "content": ["Erik ten Hag's fate had been on the line through the lack of public backing since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS gained control of football operations at Old Trafford in February.", "Even winning the FA Cup - beating Manchester City so unexpectedly last month - did not end the doubts.", "The moment of glory was overshadowed by the sense Ten Hag's job was at risk following an end-of-season review, with word spreading of candidates already being approached.", "The honours' board shows the addition of a piece of silverware - just as he could produce the League Cup at last year's inquest into the season.", "But the biggest prize in English football proved elusive - just as it has been for the five permanent managers to fill the United hotseat since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after hoisting the Premier League trophy for a 13th and final time.", "Ten Hag was further than any counterpart from winning it. Eighth place was United's lowest-ever finish in the Premier League and the worst season since 1990.", "That was almost four years into Sir Alex's reign - the Scot benefiting from patience not afforded to his successors by taking six full seasons to win his first title.", "Perhaps it's understandable Ten Hag was expected to make United more competitive sooner.", "The financial firepower of Manchester City - winners of six of the last seven Premier League titles - cannot be an excuse.", "After all, Ten Hag has benefited from more than \u00a3400m in new recruits.", "But United finished 31 points behind Manchester City as their neighbours won a fourth consecutive Premier League title."]}
