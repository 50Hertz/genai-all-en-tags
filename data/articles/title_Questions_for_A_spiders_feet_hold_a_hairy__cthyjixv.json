Like the fictional Spider-Man, spiders and many other animals can easily scale walls, scamper across ceilings and affix themselves to other surfaces. Name as many different types of animals as you can that can do this, which people and dogs, for instance, cannot.", "During Reading:", "1. What is the name for the way that spiders attach themselves to upright (and even upside down) surfaces?", "2. What are spatulae, where are they and what role do they appear to play in the spider\u2019s ability to adhere to any surface?", "3. To what do the spatulae bond?", "4. What happened when Schaber Clemens\u2019s team first tried to pull hair tufts off of a spider\u2019s leg?", "5. In what direction do the hairs on a spider\u2019s leg point? What does Sarah Stellwagen say about the value of the direction in which those hairs are oriented?", "6. Schaber\u2019s team developed a new glove. What does he describe as its amazing feat?", "After Reading:", "1. In most cases, the way that wall-climbing animals adhere to surfaces won\u2019t easily work with far larger animals (such as people). Is that likely also to be true for the new technology described in this story? Explain why or why not, using information you derived from the story."]}
