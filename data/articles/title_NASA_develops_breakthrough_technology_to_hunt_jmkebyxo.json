This existence of subsurface oceans has made them compelling targets for future missions.", "However, it is a tough challenge for scientists to penetrate these icy shells using conventional remote-sensing instruments like cameras and radar.", "The scientists need to depend on other techniques till they start sending landers or rovers which can either melt or drill through the ice for detecting the hidden water bodies.", "What is magnetometry?", "Magnetometry has emerged as a promising method to detect subsurface oceans. The magnetic fields can penetrate any solid material and give valuable insights regarding the interior of planet-sized bodies.", "Solid-state quantum magnetometers have shown the groundbreaking advancement achieved in the field of magnetometry.", "Watch: Strongest sign of alien found: The search for life beyond earth", "The instruments can provide competitive sensitivities while at the same time boasting reduced power requirements, smaller size and lower weight, in comparison to traditional magnetometers.", "The solid-state quantum magnetometers also have unique quantum advantages, such as self-calibration through spin-nuclear quantum interaction. This helps them compensate for drifts over time.", "(With inputs from agencies)"]}
