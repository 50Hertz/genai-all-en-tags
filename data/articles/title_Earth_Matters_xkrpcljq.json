Their responses have been edited for clarity.", "What sets GLOBE apart from other education programs?", "Tony Murphy: GLOBE has a strong community of citizen scientists, students, and teachers all over the world who are eager to contribute to Earth system science research. GLOBE allows people to contribute to data collection and submission, to understand the scientific research process and the work of scientists, and to see how their local environment fits into the regional and global environment.", "Caryn Long: I have used GLOBE in my classroom for five years now. GLOBE is different from other science education programs because it educates students while also immersing them in the practical and applied nature of science. Knowing they are contributing to real research with NASA scientists is a powerful motivational tool to get them to practice the skills of observation, data collection, and analysis in a real and meaningful way. They want to practice the skills they are developing because what they are doing is valued.", "How do your students contribute to GLOBE, and what do they most enjoy about it?", "Long: Our classroom participates in the Cloud, Aerosols and Hydrology Protocols and the Surface Temperature Field Campaign at the lake behind our school. We are adding more protocols each year. Each time I share with my students that we are learning a new protocol to add to their toolbox, they are excited to get started. What my students have enjoyed most about GLOBE is meeting some of the scientists that are involved with the program. Another highlight for them is gathering the cloud data because it involves NASA satellites. Receiving the email matches with the satellites is exciting to the kids because they love comparing what they saw from a ground level to what the satellite has viewed.", "What are some highlights from your time as director of the GLOBE Implementation Office?", "Murphy: Seeing students communicate their research at meetings, and especially at the two GLOBE Learning Expeditions I have attended, has been truly amazing. GLOBE Learning Expeditions are week-long, student-focused events held every few years at sites around the world. I gave a scientific presentation at a national science competition in Ireland when I was in middle school. That experience had a major influence on my life, so it\u2019s incredible to see so many GLOBE participants have a similar opportunity.", "What is most exciting about the AGU award?", "Murphy: The GLOBE community has grown tremendously from a small number of countries in 1995 to 126 countries today with a database of over 200 million measurements for use in research by students and scientists.

The data came down, it was processed flawlessly through the system \u2014 it was amazing! Everything worked. Here you have this 11-meter dish collecting data from something you can hold in one hand.\u201d", "The mission could have ended at that time, but, of course, it didn\u2019t. Although pursued as a proof-of-concept, Feldman admits he had bigger plans for SeaHawk from the start.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be worth NASA\u2019s investment to do a one-off, get one image, prove the concept, and go home,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal from the beginning was to integrate this mission into the infrastructure that we have built over the past 25 years to support ocean color satellites, and to demonstrate that a CubeSat can be treated like a normal, credible scientific mission.\u201d", "Click here to read more about the origins, development, and performance of SeaHawk and HawkEye.", "The American West is in the grip of an exceptional drought.

A positive energy imbalance means the Earth system is gaining energy, causing the planet to heat up. The doubling of the energy imbalance is the topic of a recent study published June 15 in Geophysical Research Letters.", "Scientists at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration compared data from two independent sets of measurements. NASA\u2019s Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite sensors measure how much energy enters and leaves Earth\u2019s system. A global array of ocean floats, called Argo, provide data to enable an accurate estimate of the rate at which the world\u2019s oceans are warming. Since approximately 90 percent of the excess energy from an energy imbalance ends up in the ocean, the overall trends of incoming and outgoing radiation should broadly agree with changes in ocean heat content.", "\u201cThe two very independent ways of looking at changes in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance are in really, really good agreement, and they\u2019re both showing this very large trend, which gives us a lot of confidence that what we\u2019re seeing is a real phenomenon and not just an instrumental artifact,\u201d said Norman Loeb, lead author for the study and principal investigator for CERES at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center. \u201cThe trends we found were quite alarming in a sense.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s likely a mix of anthropogenic forcing and internal variability,\u201d said Loeb. \u201cAnd over this period they\u2019re both causing warming, which leads to a fairly large change in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance. The magnitude of the increase is unprecedented.\u201d", "Increases in emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the atmosphere, capturing outgoing radiation that would otherwise escape into space. The warming drives other changes, such as the melting of snow and ice, increased water vapor, and cloud changes that can further enhance the warming. Earth\u2019s energy imbalance is the net effect of all these factors.", "In order to determine the factors driving the imbalance, the investigators examined changes in clouds, water vapor, trace gases, the output of light from the Sun, Earth\u2019s surface albedo (the amount of light reflected by the surface), atmospheric aerosols, and changes in surface and atmospheric temperature distributions.", "The scientists found that the doubling of the energy imbalance is partially the result an increase in greenhouse gases from human activity, also known as anthropogenic forcing. It can also be attributed to increases in water vapor, which traps more outgoing longwave radiation and further contributes to Earth\u2019s energy imbalance. The related decrease in clouds and sea ice also lead to more absorption of solar energy.", "The authors also found that a flip of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from a cool phase to a warm phase likely played a major role in the intensification of the energy imbalance. The PDO is a pattern of Pacific climate variability in which a massive wedge of water in the eastern Pacific goes through cool and warm phases. This naturally occurring internal variability in the ocean can have far-reaching effects on weather and climate. An intensely warm PDO phase that began around 2014 and continued until 2020 caused a widespread reduction in cloud coverage over the ocean and a corresponding increase in the absorption of solar radiation.", "\u201cThe lengthening and highly complementary records from Argo and CERES have allowed us both to pin down Earth\u2019s energy imbalance with increasing accuracy, and to study its variations and trends with increasing insight, as time goes on,\u201d said Gregory Johnson, co-author on the study and physical oceanographer at NOAA\u2019s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. \u201cObserving the magnitude and variations of this energy imbalance are vital to understanding Earth\u2019s changing climate.\u201d", "Loeb cautions that the study is only a snapshot relative to long-term climate change, and that it is not possible to predict with any certainty what the coming decades might look like for Earth\u2019s energy budget. The study does conclude, however, that unless the rate of heat uptake subsides, greater changes in climate should be expected.", "harmony: 1. A pleasing arrangement of parts. 2.
