The pepperoni stuffed cheesy bread was a renovation of an existing item, while the New York style pizza was developed in response to a specific request for a crust that was foldable, Reddy said.", "Discussing the pizza chain\u2019s evolving strategy to new product innovation, Reddy said Domino\u2019s will take items off the menu because it wants to retain \u201coperational complexity\u201d in stores.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve done that in the past, and we may do that in the future as well,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to make sure they deliver newness and just proliferate. And we don\u2019t have a lot of waste building into the menu as we go through this to maximize franchisee profitability again.\u201d", "He also discussed how marketing and deals with other companies such as Uber Eats will impact its goal of at least 3% mix of sales by the end of this year.", "\u201cAnd I think the 3% mix was an important milestone to set for investors to understand what the expected cadence was going to be,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cAnd what I would say is if you go and look at the launch quarter was Q4 where we initially started, we had a 0.4% mix in Q4, we ended up with a 1.4% mix in Q1. And we did say we\u2019re going to build steadily as we continue to ramp up the marketing toward the 3% exit rate at the end of the year.", "\u201cAnd we feel that we\u2019re on track. I mean that all the plans that we had in the beginning of the launch period, we are actually seeing it materialize. And I think as we go along, we will actually evaluate how things are going and what tweaks to make, if any. But what I would say is the 3% was more a mix input that we provided to investors to help everybody to model and think about it, but really what\u2019s most fundamental to our story is the algorithm.\u201d", "Reddy went on to discuss how retail sales growth and operating income growth factor into this 3% mix goal.", "\u201cWe may focus on 7% retail sales growth at 8% operating income growth and how the 3% mix plays into that is good but it\u2019s less relevant than they are going to mature at 10% retail sales growth, 8% operating income growth and we\u2019ll continue to toggle that,\u201d Reddy said."]}
