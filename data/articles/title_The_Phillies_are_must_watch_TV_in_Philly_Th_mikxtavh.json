It was pretty incredible.\u201d", "It\u2019s been that way all season for the Phillies, who have been one of baseball\u2019s hottest teams, sitting comfortably atop the National League East with one of the best records in baseball.", "Through Tuesday\u2019s win against the Red Sox, NBC Sports Philadelphia and NBC10 have averaged more than 360,000 viewers per game across television and streaming, according to Nielsen numbers provided by the network. That\u2019s up 30% over last year\u2019s numbers, with the Phillies coming off their improbable World Series run.", "Since mid-May, with the Phillies\u2019 hot streak continuing, their TV ratings on NBC Sports Philadelphia have ballooned to an average of 420,000 viewers watching the game, either on TV or streaming it through the NBC Sports app. There is still no way for fans to stream Phillies games without subscribing to another service.", "Regardless, more people are tuning in to watch the Phillies on any given night than are watching Jeopardy! or the 6 p.m. edition of Action News in Philadelphia. It\u2019s also close to the nearly 424,000 average viewers who tune in nightly to 6ABC to watch ABC World News Tonight with David Muir.", "\u201cThe vibe is amazing on every level,\u201d McCarthy said, comparing the energy surrounding the team to the World Series squad in 2008, led by Jimmy Rollins, Chase Utley, and Ryan Howard.", "Having a winning record is certainly a draw, but McCarthy thinks there are other reasons fans are gravitating toward the team. For starters, their core squad has been together for several years, which has allowed their personalities to evolve. There\u2019s also an entertaining mix of younger players and veterans, from the emergence of second baseman Bryson Stott to the electric showmanship of superstar Bryce Harper.", "There\u2019s also left fielder Brandon Marsh, whom McCarthy thinks has become a fan favorite thanks to his unique personality and \u201ceveryday guy\u201d stature, which is similar to another bearded Philly athlete, Jason Kelce. Marsh went viral last month after being mic\u2019d up on ESPN, where, among other things, he sang a line from rapper BossMan Dlow\u2019s \u201cGet In With Me.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a little old-school personality to [the beard] that you can see from a distance, and people like that kind of stuff,\u201d McCarthy said.", "The Phillies have also been popular across the country. The team has appeared two times this season on ESPN\u2019s Sunday Night Baseball, averaging 1.67 million viewers, up 10% compared to last year, according to Nielsen numbers. Apple doesn\u2019t release viewership figures for games that stream on its Friday Night Baseball package, which will feature the Phillies next week facing the Arizona Diamondbacks in a rematch of last year\u2019s National League Championship Series.", "There\u2019s also the Phillies\u2019 recent trip to London to play the New York Mets. Saturday\u2019s game averaged 1.6 million viewers on Fox, despite gripes over the network\u2019s pregame coverage. Even with its 10 a.m. starting time, Sunday\u2019s London game on ESPN drew 1.36 million viewers. Saturday\u2019s game was down a bit from Cubs-Cardinals last year, but Sunday\u2019s game was up 17% in viewership.", "\u201cGoing from place to place in London to do visits and appearances, [Phillies] fans were everywhere,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe Mets didn\u2019t have that.\u201d", "\u00bb READ MORE: NBC Sports Chicago is closing. What that means for NBC Sports Philadelphia.", "Phillies have the second-highest attendance in baseball", "Part of the reason the games on television have been so exciting is because of the playoff atmosphere at Citizens Bank Park, which is unusual for games in April and May.", "As a result, ticket sales have been brisk. Through their first 37 home games, the Phillies are averaging 40,017 fans per game at Citizens Bank Park, the second-highest average attendance in the major leagues, behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. They\u2019re the only teams that are averaging more than 40,000.", "\u201cOur high attendance is due to so many factors, including our growing season-ticket base and all our players contributing,\u201d said John Weber, the Phillies\u2019 senior vice president for ticket operations and projects.", "It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the Phillies are 22-3 in their last 25 games at Citizens Bank Park.", "\u201dIt\u2019s really special,\u201d Weber said.", "Two-thirds of MLB teams have seen their attendance numbers increase this season, according to Baseball Reference. That\u2019s at least in part in response to MLB\u2019s recent rules changes, which have shortened games by adding a pitch clock and banning the infield shift.", "The New York Mets have seen the worst decline in the league, averaging 25,852 fans at Citi Field this season, a drop of more than 28% from last year.", "NL Standings"]}
