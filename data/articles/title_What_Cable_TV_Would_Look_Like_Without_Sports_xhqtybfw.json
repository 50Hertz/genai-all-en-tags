{"title": "What Cable TV Would Look Like Without Sports", "timestamp": "\"2024-06-10 21:25:38\"", "content": ["ESPN ran a promotional campaign in the mid-2000s called \u201cWithout Sports\u201d that posited the world would be less interesting and less connected in the absence of athletic competition (and, of course, ESPN\u2019s exhaustive coverage of it).", "The 2024 version of that campaign might go something like, \u201cWithout sports, would anyone be watching cable?\u201d The answer is yes \u2014 but in far smaller numbers than in a landscape where live sports are abundantly available via cable and satellite providers.", "Nielsen\u2019s seven-day ratings for the 2023-24 TV season show sports dominating the top of the rankings among all viewers and the key ad-sales demographic of adults 18-49. In total viewers, live sports telecasts \u2014 led by ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football with 7.38 million viewers (not including simulcasts on ABC) \u2014 capture nine of the top 10 spots and 12 of the top 20 among primetime cable shows, counting titles with at least three telecasts. NBA playoffs coverage on ESPN and TNT, Major League Baseball\u2019s postseason and the NCAA women\u2019s basketball tournament all rank in the top 10.", "It\u2019s not until the No. 10 spot that a non-sports show, History Channel\u2019s The Curse of Oak Island, shows up. Three more sports programs come ahead of the second non-sports show in the top 20, Hallmark\u2018s When Calls the Heart. News programming takes four of the final six spots.", "Removing sports from the ledger puts The Curse of Oak Island and When Calls the Heart in the top two spots, but their viewer averages \u2014 3.14 million and 2.77 million \u2014 are less than half of the top sports events. (For comparison, those two shows would rank 75th and 83rd among broadcast network series in 2023-24.) Primetime shows on Fox News and MSNBC hold six of the top 20 slots, with the rest distributed among History, Hallmark, TLC, Discovery, HGTV, USA and Bravo.", "Among adults under 50, sports is even more dominant. Fourteen of the top 15 shows with adults 18-49 are live sports, and the 15th \u2014 WWE Monday Night Raw on USA \u2014 is also an athletic competition (albeit one with predetermined outcomes). TLC\u2019s Sister Wives and Bravo\u2019s Vanderpump Rules are the only sports-free shows to rank in the top 20 among adults 18-49.", "Below are the top 20 primetime cable shows for the 2023-24 season based on Nielsen\u2019s seven-day ratings (which don\u2019t include streaming), with and without sports in the mix."]}
