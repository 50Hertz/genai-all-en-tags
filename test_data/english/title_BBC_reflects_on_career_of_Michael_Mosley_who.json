I\u2019m feeling mildly apprehensive. Well, I think I\u2019m confident that it should be safe.", "\u201cIt is very strange thought that there are millions of people who are infected by parasites who don\u2019t want to be, and I\u2019m about to deliberately infect myself, but, I hope it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to regret.
