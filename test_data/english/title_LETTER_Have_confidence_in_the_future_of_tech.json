{"title": "LETTER: Have confidence in the future of technology", "timestamp": "\"2024-06-11 11:27:00\"", "content": ["Climate change is real. Scientific evidence continues to show that human activities (primarily the human burning of fossil fuels) have warmed Earth's surface and its ocean basins, which in turn have continued to impact Earth's climate.", "Just recently, data released by European climate scientists showed May was the twelfth consecutive month during which average global temperatures surpassed all observations since 1850, and probably for any extended period for more than 100,000 years.", "It is up to each of us to do what we are able to reduce our carbon imprint \u2013 which is defined thus: A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gasses (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.", "So I was encouraged by the article in Itasca-Mantrap Electric Coop's (IM) recent \u201cNewsline\u201d newsletter, in which CEO Christine Fox gave an update on how her organization is keeping an eye on emerging technologies that may impact their customers' lives. She reported on how IM purchased an electric vehicle (EV) to understand firsthand the impacts and benefits of EV ownership.", "Along with this initiative, IM is also sponsoring a forum in July that will explore the latest innovations and trends in renewable energy. This forum promises to provide insightful discussions led by experts in the field on topics ranging from solar and wind power to sustainable transportation solutions.I want to commend CEO Fox on these efforts that should educate us and provide information and data on how these emerging technologies can and will affect our lives.", "I have had conversations with naysayers that dismiss \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives, saying there are too many problems \u2013 we can't rely on solar because the sun doesn't shine all the time; we can't rely on wind power because the wind doesn't blow all the time; EV batteries fail in winter; EV batteries will fill our landfills, etc.", "Yes, we do have challenges. But that is \"today.\" Look where we've come since \"yesterday,\" and we have to have faith in the brilliant engineers and scientists that continuing innovations will meet the challenges of \"tomorrow.\"", "Technology is moving at breakneck speed. An example of how technology has evolved over the years, I remember \u201cyesterday\u201d and my first job out of college in 1968 at Control Data Corp (CDC). CDC was a mainframe and supercomputer company that in the 1960s was one of the nine major U.S. computer companies. CDC's 6600 supercomputer required an immense amount of space, upwards of 10,000 square feet.", "Fast forward to today and that smartphone in your backpocket surpasses the combined computing power of all the computers used in the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.", "So again, we need to have confidence in the future of technology and that the challenges we face today can and will be conquered in the future.", "And I would be remiss in not pointing out that one political party has taken on the challenge of climate change head on by working to provide consumer incentives and business incentives to keep us moving forward, while another political party's presumptive presidential nominee still calls it a hoax."]}
