However, we concentrate more on how to enable the AI to recognise and express expressions and emotions.\"", "As an Ex-Robots worker moves her head, smiles and sticks out her tongue, a humanoid robot mimics her movement thanks to tiny motors installed in several spaces in its head.", "\"We are also working on the foundation model. The model we're making is multi-modal and capable of emotional expression. It can perceive the surrounding environment and produce appropriate facial feedback,\" Li said.", "Ex-Robots said it takes from two weeks to a month to produce a humanoid robot, with prices ranging from 1.5 million yuan ($207,000) to 2 million yuan.", "The main purpose of the company's robots so far is for display in museums, one of which Ex-Robots has housed in the same building as its factory.", "Looking ahead, Li believes humanoid robots will have a bigger role to play in the healthcare and education industries.", "\"Psychological counselling and health are certainly future application scenarios.
