I had no idea where the ball was, but it all worked out very well.\u201d", "Varda sent the third pitch he faced to left field, bringing Popp home to give the Knights a 3-2 advantage.", "Owen Baij slammed the door on the Cardinals in the bottom of the seventh and Norway secured its spot in the Division 4 state title game on Saturday.", "\u201cI was just trying to throw strikes, make them hit the ball and let my team do the other work,\u201d Owen Baij said.", "Although things were tight throughout, Norway head coach Tony Adams was expecting that type of contest.", "\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the way it needed to play out,\u201d coach Adams said. \u201cWe needed to be in a tight ball game. We learned, in the first inning, that their best pitcher, we\u2019ve seen. So any sort of fear, if there was any, was gone.\u201d", "The Knights face Beal City at 1:30 p.m. Central standard time at Drayton McLane Stadium in East Lansing. The Aggies are the reigning champions in Division 4.", "\u201cI was told we\u2019re the second team ever from the U.P. to make the championship game,\u201d coach Adams said. So, we\u2019re on Cloud 9 and we\u2019re looking forward to taking a shot at Beal City.\u201d", "Junior Cole Baij picked up the win on the mound for Norway. He struck out three in six innings of work while surrendering four hits and an earned run.", "\u201cFirst one wasn\u2019t on him and that happens. But that\u2019s Cole (Baij),\u201d coach Adams said. \u201cHe does not lose his composure. He battled through six against a team that is a good hitting team. They don\u2019t chase the ball and our defense held up.\u201d", "Owen Baij picked up the save. He struck out one in one inning on the bump.", "\u201cIt was a little tougher, I mean, the strike zone just keeps shrinking every week,\u201d Cole Baij said. \u201cI just battled through it. I went to many pitches on a couple of kids \u2026 And then my brother came in and saved the day.\u201d", "Cardinal Mooney Catholic looked to be threatening at the start of the seventh inning, however, senior Hayden Amundson made a spectacular catch, on a shallow fly ball, in the outfield to help secure the win.", "\u201cThat ball, honestly, didn\u2019t think it was catchable,\u201d Amundson said. \u201cI ran up and realized it was last minute, made the catch. Honestly, I was hoping all three of those last outs would go to me.\u201d", "He caught six fly balls in the game.", "\u201cI was hoping for something more exciting, they just hit them right at me for the most part,\u201d Hayden Amundson said. \u201cThe whole time I was sitting there, in my mind, I begged them to hit it to me. Anything I can do to help the defense.\u201d", "The Cardinals took advantage of a Norway error in the bottom of the first inning to open the scoring. However, they only got one run across and they held a 1-0 advantage.", "Norway responded in the next half inning, using back-to-back walks to score Maddex Burklund. Owen Baij drove in run in the frame as well and the Knights held a 2-1 lead.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really easy, we don\u2019t ask our kids to be perfect, we just ask them to present and they\u2019ve been present,\u201d coach Adams said.", "Cardinal Mooney Catholic tied the game at two in the bottom of the fourth, on a wild pitch. However, that was the last run the Cardinals would muster.", "\u201cGoing into this game, we kind of had a normal mood,\u201d Amundson said, \u201cJust another game. But as it went on, nearing the end there, I was pretty hyped. I was like, \u2018Oh my God. We\u2019re going to the state championship.\u201d", "Not only are the Knights in the final game, they\u2019re looking to get it done for their senior teammates.", "\u201cThey\u2019re great teammates, great friends and we want to win it for them,\u201d Cole Baij said about Norway\u2019s seniors.", "But, that doesn\u2019t mean the seniors aren\u2019t just as invested.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just such an amazing feeling that everybody on our team wants it as bad as we do,\u201d Popp said.", "Offensively, Norway received contributions from multiple players. Varda, Landon Amundson and Owen Baij each tallied one RBI. Owen Baij and Alex Ortman had two hits apiece while Cole Baij, Varda, Bryce Adams, Burklund and Popp each had one. Varda, Landon Amundson and Burklund each drew a free pass while Varda joined Adams with one stolen base."]}
