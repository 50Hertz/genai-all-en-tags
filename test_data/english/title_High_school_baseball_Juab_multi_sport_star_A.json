However, it is uncommon for an athlete from a small school to earn all-state honors multiple times in multiple sports while also being recognized as the top athlete in the state for a particular sport.", "Fortunately for Juab, BYU commit and junior Austin Park was extraordinary enough to accomplish just that while also being named the 16th Deseret News Mr. Baseball.", "\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve loved baseball,\u201d Park said. \u201cI\u2019ve loved other sports too, but baseball has always been my favorite. I loved growing up in a small town where you knew everybody, and it gave me the chance to play multiple sports. I think playing other sports also helped me grow in baseball.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s great to represent Juab. It\u2019s a great community and I\u2019m happy I\u2019m able to show everybody what we\u2019re about.\u201d", "Alongside baseball, Park is the starting quarterback for the football team and made the 3A basketball all-state first and second teams the last two years.", "Juab baseball head coach Josh Park said he believes Austin\u2019s ability to play multiple sports has made him a better player.", "\u201cI think he represents a lot of small-town kids where they\u2019re multisport athletes,\u201d coach Park said. \u201cHe loves to play, he plays a lot and he plays all the sports a lot and I think that contributes to his success. It\u2019s really fun to watch him and his teammates in the success that they\u2019ve had.\u201d", "As the baseball season progressed, Austin Park consistently delivered at the plate and led the state with a .568 batting average and 58 RBIs. It was the second-highest single-season RBI total in state history. He was also third in the state with a 0.989 slugging percentage and ended the season with seven home runs and 19 stolen bases.", "He didn\u2019t contribute just at the plate, though. On the mound, he tallied 80 strikeouts in 43 innings pitched and held a 7-1 record.", "Neither Austin nor coach Park checked his stats throughout the season. While Austin was having a standout season, to coach Park it felt like it was the norm.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to downplay at all what Austin did this year, but for me, it was just him being Austin and he\u2019s done that for years,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until towards the end of the season that I started looking at the numbers and realized, \u2018Wow, he\u2019s having an incredible season.\u2019 As it was all happening it just seemed like it was just Austin being Austin.\u201d", "Austin Park intentionally avoided checking his stats throughout the season, only looking at them after being knocked out of the state tournament by Union in mid-May. He made this decision to stay focused on his game and to help him enjoy playing baseball again.", "\u201cLast year I got caught up in my stats and I was so focused on, \u2018I need to have this stat and I need to keep my averages up,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI had a few goals at the start of the season, and I just wanted to have fun playing baseball again without any worries or distractions. It helped a ton, and it cleared my head and let me be me.\u201d", "The strategy worked as he helped lead the Wasps to a 21-8 record and a Region 12 title, and although they came up short of a state title, the loss has only motivated Austin more, and he knows he can help the Wasps win another state title in his senior year.", "\u201cLosing that one motivates all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt like we could\u2019ve gone back-to-back. We know we could\u2019ve done it and we know we\u2019ll come back and work a lot harder. We have that goal to win it next year.\u201d", "Past Deseret News Mr. Baseball winners", "2023 \u2014 Tyler Ball, Skyridge.", "2022 \u2014 Luke Anderson, Snow Canyon", "2021 \u2014 Fisher Ingersoll, American Fork", "2019 \u2014 Brock Watkins, Pleasant Grove", "2018 \u2014 Tyson Fisher, Dixie", "2017 \u2014 Seth Corry, Lone Peak", "2016 \u2014 Payton Henry, Pleasant Grove", "2015 \u2014 Easton Walker, Pleasant Grove", "2014 \u2014 Colton Shaver, Jordan", "2013 \u2014 Riley Ottesen, American Fork", "2012 \u2014 Dallas Carroll, Taylorsville", "2011 \u2014 Kayden Porter, Spanish Fork", "2010 \u2014 Marcus Littlewood, Pine View", "2009 \u2014 Marcus Littlewood, Pine View"]}
