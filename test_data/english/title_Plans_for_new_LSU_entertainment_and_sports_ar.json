Some of those are Zydeco hockey games, which will be allowed to stay at the current arena since sports events have a cap of 8,500.", "Several members of the Metro Council, including Carolyn Coleman, whose district includes downtown, are on board with the proposal. She did not return a request for comment Monday.", "\"I would say the gain is the fact that we are going to have a new asset located on LSU's campus that can bring large scale entertainment to large scale venues that Baton Rouge really and truly should be hosting,\" Gaudet said.", "The mayor called it \"an opportunity...to bring a significant parishwide benefit\" in a statement sent to WBRZ.", "It's much too early to determine a project cost\u2014but according to the Metro Council's draft ordinance\u2014it will be structured as a public-private partnership, estimated to exceed $300 million. TAF will be on the hook for coming up with the money."]}
