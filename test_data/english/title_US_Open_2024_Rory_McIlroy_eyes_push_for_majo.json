I just stayed disciplined and when I got myself in trouble, I took my medicine, two-putted.", "\"This is the whole thing about a US Open, it's trying to keep clean scorecards like this. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to keep it bogey-free for the rest of the week... but it's not about how many birdies you make, it's about how many bogeys you don't make.\"", "\"I had a run of pars from the 11th through to 15th where I had chances and wasn't able to convert.

He will want three more days of that. He was focused, he minimised his mistakes and he executed well with good putting.", "\"That's a tremendous day. If he keeps that intensity and focus for three more days, then he might finally break that 10-year duck.", "Rich Beem, 2002 PGA Championship winner: \"He has got off to such sluggish starts in the past few years, so it's nice to see him come out full of energy, playing great and with everything spot on.
