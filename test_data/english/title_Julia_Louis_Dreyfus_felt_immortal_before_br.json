This, at some point, is going to end.'", "\"You don't go through life thinking about that very much. So it puts into sharp focus priorities. It did for me.\"", "The actress added about how the diagnosis changed her perspective on life: \"I made more of an attitude shift about what my priorities were and how to sort of go forth.\"", "Julia previously told WSJ Magazine the first thing she did when her doctor told her she had cancer was double over with laughter.", "She said: \"I mean, it felt like it was written.

It's like the world snapped into focus. I cleared away stuff I didn't want anymore. I held on tightly to the things I did.\""]}
