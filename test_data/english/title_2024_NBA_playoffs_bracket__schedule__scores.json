The Boston Celtics opened a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven series against the Mavericks after a 105-98 win in Game 2 on Sunday night in Boston. Now, the Celtics are two wins away from their first NBA title in 16 years.", "Jrue Holiday had 26 points and 11 rebounds to lead another balanced scoring attack for Boston in Game 2. Jayson Tatum made up for a rough shooting night with 12 assists and nine rebounds to go with his 18 points. Jaylen Brown scored 21 with three steals, while Derrick White had 18 points and three steals.", "Kristaps Porzingis suffered a rare injury in Game 2 as his status for Wednesday is still up in the air.", "Luka Doncic, who will reportedly receive a painkilling injection ahead of Game 3 for thoracic contusion, led all scorers with 32 points for Dallas on Sunday. He also finished with 11 assists and 11 rebounds for a triple-double but will need more help from his surrounding cast to avoid a 3-0 hole.", "\"It's not all on him. It's a team,\" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said of Doncic, who had been battling chest, knee and ankle injuries. \"We've got to find someone to join Luka and [Kyrie Irving] in that scoring category.\"", "Irving, who scored 16 points in Game 2, has lost 12 games in a row against his former team, the Celtics.", "The Celtics, who have not lost on the road this postseason, are looking for their first NBA title since 2008. Meanwhile, the Mavericks are taking aim at their second title in franchise history and their first since 2011. Regardless of which of these remaining teams win the 2024 title, the NBA will have its sixth different champion in six years -- something that has not happened since 1975-1980.", "The postseason field started with 20 teams, and now we're down to two. The Warriors, Kings, Hawks and Bulls were ousted in the Play-In Tournament before the Pelicans, Suns, Clippers, Lakers, Heat, 76ers, Bucks and Magic were eliminated in the first round. The Cavaliers, Thunder, Knicks and Nuggets were sent home in the second round with the Pacers and Timberwolves bowing out in the conference finals.", "Here's a look at the upcoming schedule, as well as all the playoff scores.
