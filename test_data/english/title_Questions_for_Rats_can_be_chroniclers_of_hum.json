What types of things might scientists be able to learn from rats\u2019 collections that they might not learn about from studying artifacts collected by people? Some aspects to consider include who might collect objects and what types of objects people may decide have value.", "2. Many types of scientists combine multiple areas of science in their research, such as combining the study of ecology and the study of the past. In this way, they can learn about ecosystems in ancient environments. What are two areas of science that you might like to combine? What are some questions about the world that you could explore with your new field of research?"]}
