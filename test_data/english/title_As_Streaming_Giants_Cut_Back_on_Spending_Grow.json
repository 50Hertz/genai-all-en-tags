Their content spending budgets have fallen by 19 percent since then, \u201ceven as they continue substantial investments in film and TV content,\u201d the firm said. It also highlighted a decline of nearly 1 billion euro ($1.3 billion) in the linear TV advertising market over the past decade.", "\u201cDespite these obstacles, commercial broadcasters have demonstrated adaptability by intensifying their focus on streaming strategies,\u201d according to Ampere. \u201cThe next few years present a strategic opportunity for broadcasters amidst a slowdown in spending by the major streaming services. Investment by global streamers in European-sourced content is forecast to grow by 8 percent year-on-year in 2025, compared to an average annual growth rate of 35 percent between 2021 and 2024.\u201d", "Explained the research company: \u201cIndustry giants, including Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery, are scaling back streaming spend growth to ensure sustained profitability, paving the way for national broadcasters to capitalize on this shift.\u201d", "As such, maintaining or increasing content investment levels is \u201ccrucial\u201d for broadcasters to \u201cdifferentiate themselves in an industry where major global streamers are adopting more conservative spending strategies,\u201d Ampere concluded. \u201cBold commissioning decisions can set broadcasters apart, drive engagement and advertising revenue.\u201d", "Ampere estimates content spend by European commercial broadcasters to remain fairly steady at $8.7 billion this year after $8.5 billion in 2023 and $8.7 billion in 2022, with a slight gain to $8.8 billion forecast for 2025. Public broadcasters are seen following a similar trend to hit $8.4 billion this year and $8.5 billion next year after $8.4 billion in 2023. Pay TV companies will also see little change, the research firm projects, moving from $6 billion in both 2023 and 2024 to $5.9 billion in 2025.", "Meanwhile, streamers\u2019 content spend jumped from $7.2 billion in 2022 to $8.5 billion in 2023 and is estimated to reach $10.6 billion this year. In 2025, Ampere forecasts a slighter gain to $11.4 billion.", "Beyond content spending decisions, European broadcasters must also \u201cprioritize the transition of audiences to streaming to ensure their long-term relevance,\u201d it argued. This involves the likes of investing in their streaming platforms, expanding content libraries, enhancing digital advertising capabilities, experimenting with content release strategies across linear and streaming platforms, as well as \u201ctailoring content output to cater to younger demographics.\u201d", "Said Neil Anderson, senior analyst at Ampere Analysis: \u201cDespite the short-term benefits of cutting costs during economic downturn, prioritizing long-term investment in both content and streaming capabilities is crucial for commercial broadcasters to maintain prominence in Europe\u2019s cut-throat TV market.\u201d"]}
